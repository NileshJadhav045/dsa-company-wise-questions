     * Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using
     * the following operations:
     * Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
     * For example, abcde -> aecdb
     * Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into
     * another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
     * For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into
     * a's)
     * You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
     * 
     * Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close,
     * and false otherwise.
